Detecting threads on Reddit needing moderator attention using NLP
Reddit is a website that hosts a collection of forums, “subreddits”, where users can make posts. These posts, also called “threads”, including for example links to other websites and text posts, other users can then comment on these posts, and “upvote” and “downvote” each other. These subreddits are moderated by users and therefore they use their own free time to ensure a high quality of threads on the subreddits they moderate. Certain subreddits such as /r/politics can attract unwanted, uncivil discussion and /r/AskScience answers, anecdotes that do not meet their guidelines on threads leading to them being “locked” by the moderators. Thus people can not comment anymore. Locking is often used when it is not possible to look at every single comment on a thread, moderators can also delete individuals comments or whole posts.
